## Completed
---
User story 14 was completed.

## Which ones didn't and why
---
The rest of the user stories were not completed because most were written to describe the ending features/state of the project,
not necessarilly intermediate steps. Currently, user story 13 is next to be completed and from there, adding features, that are
supported by the backend, should be implemented at a better rate.
