## Frontend unit tests (Cypress)
+ Per the guidelines of a TA, created 3 tests in cypress. 
+ One fills out the form completely and submits a review successfully. 
+ The second enters a string into the integer-only rating field and fails. 
+ The third only partially fills out the review but successfully adds it.
